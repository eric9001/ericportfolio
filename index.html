        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My passion for web developement comes from me wanting to create something from nothing and have that certain thing do something useful! I simply enjoy building things and seeing how they work. Some other things I enjoy doing would be live streaming video game playthroughs because you know those are fun to watch! I have a musical background so I enjoy listening to music and also a hobby of mine is creating music in my band as well.  My ultimate goal is to be on a team of great people and develop exciting video games!</p>
